# Responsive Grid CSS/Sass Example

An experiment with [responsive grid system](http://www.responsivegridsystem.com/). It offers a responsive grid in under 800 bytes.

Edit the `main.scss` file (or other scss files), and rebuild the CSS by running `gulp`.

(Use `npm i` to install dependencies and/or `npm i -g gulp` if it says that it needs a global gulp.)

Start a server: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` and open [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/) in a browser.
